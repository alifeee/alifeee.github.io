      <h2>Finances</h2>
      <p>
        I'm not sure why I've made this page. I think it was on a promise of
        transparency. Anyway, here's a vague estimate of the money I have come
        across for the last few years, and that I remain to come across.

        Years are split by UK financial year, so run from 1 April to the 31
        March the next year.
