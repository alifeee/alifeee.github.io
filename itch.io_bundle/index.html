      <h2>Itch.io's Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</h2>
      <p>
        In 2020
        <a href="https://itch.io/docs/general/about">Itch.io</a> released their
        <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality"
          >Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a
        >. It got massively popular and ended up with over 1700 games/comics/RPG
        rules. Sorting through this content proved troublesome. This is an
        attempt to categorise those games.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, <a href="https://itch.io/docs/general/about">Itch.io</a> also
        released the
        <a href="https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine"
          >Bundle for Ukraine</a
        >, supporting charities helping to stop the war in Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> to access
        the webpage of each game, which was then scraped for more data using
        <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/"
          >BeautifulSoup</a
        >, a Python module for parsing HTML. The review scores, category, and a
        few other useful data were saved to a local file, which is also hosted
        here and displayed sorted by category on each bundle page below.
