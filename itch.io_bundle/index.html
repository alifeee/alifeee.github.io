  <h2>Itch.io's Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</h2>
  <p>
    In 2020 <a href="https://itch.io/docs/general/about">Itch.io</a> released their <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a>. It got massively popular and ended up with over 1700 games/comics/RPG rules. Sorting through this content proved troublesome. This is an attempt to categorise those games.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2022, <a href="https://itch.io/docs/general/about">Itch.io</a> also released the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine">Bundle for Ukraine</a>, supporting charities helping to stop the war in Ukraine.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> to access the webpage of each game, which was then scraped for more data using <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, a Python module for parsing HTML. The review scores, category, and a few other useful data were saved to a local file, which is also hosted here and displayed sorted by category on each bundle page below.
