You can find (in theory) all the books I've (recently) read, as well as the book I am (hopefully) currently reading on my [RamblingReaders](https://ramblingreaders.org/user/alifeee/) account. You can follow it on Mastodon !

Invisible Women
: ever wondered if women are intrinsically at a disadvantage? I hope so. read this book and you'll learn so much more about male-bodied crash test dummies, the benefits-for-all of clearing the snow on footpaths before roads, the tyranny of bus tickets, and way more. it's good. you should read it.
