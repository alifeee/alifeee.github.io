Sometimes, I find a really specific forum post which is so relatable but so niche at the same time. I thought a collection of them could be nice.

[STOP PUTTING MY MAIL IN JUNK!](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/stop-putting-my-mail-in-junk/6e505626-2204-4e6a-a49d-ebb142c6f3f7) by suspense author
: I want all the emails that I get sent to go to my inbox. With Microsoft's, this is simply not possible. The advice is always "add people to your contacts/safe senders list", but the emails I want to see are those from people who's emails I don't yet know, as they are new emails. It's super annoying. Anyway, it's nice to find someone who also thinks so.
