I like RSS feeds a lot, and I already know that I do. I have [several](/#feeds).

This section exists to convince you to like them too.

### My thoughts

They are a "you go to find the content" approach to consuming media (blogs/videos/podcasts), as opposed to the "the content comes and finds you" approach of modern algorithmic social media.

It's a little harder to find stuff, but if you save the feeds, you can go and read/watch/listen on your terms, and subscribe/unsubscribe based on your own thoughts, not those of a disembodied algorithm trying to match you to a pseudo-voodoo-doll version of yourself strung up by the wires of an attempt at an ever-knowing, advertising-loving, matrix-crunching computer.

That is to say, they put you in control.

### Others' thoughts

#### information

<https://aboutfeeds.com/> will let you know all about feeds.

#### opinions

Here's a comic, a blog, and a video. You have no excuse for your medium-preference.

You should read [this comic about RSS](https://audmcname.com/comics/rss-is-not-dead-yet/) titled [RSS is (not) dead (yet): *How monopolies are destroying blogs, podcasts, and webcomics*](https://audmcname.com/comics/rss-is-not-dead-yet/).

Cory Doctorow expresses his opinion in the pretty-directly-titled [You should be using an RSS reader](https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/), and Technology Connections provides us a YouTube video: [Algorithms are breaking how we think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA).

And here are three more blogs: two by ReedyBear – ["RSS could be so much better"](https://reedybear.bearblog.dev/rss-could-be-so-much-better/) and ["I've been advocating for RSS support, and you should too"](https://reedybear.bearblog.dev/ive-been-advocating-for-rss-support-and-you-should-too/); and one by Joey: ["I Ditched the Algorithm for RSS — and You Should Too"](https://joeyehand.com/blog/2025/01/15/i-ditched-the-algorithm-for-rssand-you-should-too/).

#### tools

There are several tools created by others to help find/parse/create feeds like <https://rss-is-dead.lol/> (grabs feeds from your Mastodon contacts), <https://validator.w3.org/feed/> (validates a feed you are creating).

I've also made some tools, like: [a list of common RSS URLs](https://gist.github.com/alifeee/8342d9677c436e2353233f68f34cfe19) to help find RSS feeds on sites that have them but don't link to them; [a random feed picker](https://server.alifeee.net/do/randomrss.cgi) to pick a random feed and article from a list of feeds you're subscribed to (or [use it locally](https://gist.github.com/alifeee/da157fcb92605d4fcdf3932aabcf56fe)).

There are almost infinite actual RSS *readers* you can use. Personally, I use [Feeder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play) (notably *not* "Feeder.co") on Android. I don't use my reader on any computers; if I want to read something on my PC I'll send the link from my phone there.

#### tidbits

One of my favourite sources of feeds (interest-wise) is that most things from the UK parliament have a feed, see [their page on feeds](https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/rss-feeds/).

For a source of nigh-infinite RSS feeds, have a click around some pages on my [bookmarks](/bookmarks/) page.
