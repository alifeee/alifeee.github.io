I'm not *that* involved in [cooperatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative), but I like the idea. Here are several Internet resources.

- <https://hireacoop.tech/>, awebsite for finding coops to hire
- <https://morethana.coop/>, a micro-site to explain many types of cooperative
- <https://innovation.coop/>, a coop that is reframing many business relationships in a coop sense
- <https://www.workers.coop/>, the site for Workers Coop, a federation of worker-led cooperatives
- <https://community.coops.tech/>, a coop tech forum
- <https://social.coop/>, a Mastodon instance for coop-lovers
- <https://sheffield.coop/>, a wiki of coops in Sheffield
