[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is great to play around with, and even sometimes useful!

It's great for finding obscure things, like [stink pipes](https://alifeee.co.uk/maps/#sheffield-stink-pipes), [low-emission zones](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2045639), and rare chimneys (you'll have to find examples of those yourself). You can zoom in and click "query feature", find some tags (like `historical=chimney`), then use [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) (or otherwise) to find other examples that are tagged the same way.

The data on OpenStreetMap is also community sourced, which is super interesting. Mapping for the people by the people! You can contribute by [directly editing the map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit), posting [notes](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes) about incorrect data that others (or your future self) can come and amend later, or there are also websites that make contributing specific bits of data super easy (and gamified!) like <https://streetcomplete.app/> and <https://mapcomplete.org/>.
