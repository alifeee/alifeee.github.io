When you buy a computer, you should be able to run any software on it that you want.

This makes sense to me.

Amazon's Kindle, then, is one of my least favourite little computers you can buy.

Thankfully, loads of people have worked on jailbreaking and installing custom software on the Kindle!

The [MobileRead wiki](https://wiki.mobileread.com/) has a great page on all the different Kindles that have been released: <https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Prefix_Index>, where you can read all about how to install custom software.

Alternatively, you could use the (very well put-together) guide on <https://kindlemodding.gitbook.io/>, which attempts to make the process *really* simple and understandable. I think it does well!

Once you have jailbroken a kindle, you can install a different eBook reader like [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki), and you can read `.ePub` files, `.pdf` files, websites, and a lot more stuff! And, importantly, the books and files you store on your device you can move to different devices, and share! Because they're files! They're information! And they're free to copy!

As for books, there are many places you can get free eBooks which are out-of-copyright, or released under a permissive licence, like:

- <https://standardebooks.org/ebooks>
- <https://ebookfoundation.github.io/free-programming-books/>

There are also many sites like <https://www.ebooks.com/> where you can buy eBooks at reasonable prices.

Sometimes people [simply upload their book to their websites](https://hughbarnard.org/the-algorithmic-anarchist-2nd-edition/
libgenesis) because they would love it if you read it!

And finally, if we were to read the [Guerilla Open Access Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerilla_Open_Access_Manifesto), we could come to believe that any book which provides information should be open-access, and we could in theory download any book from places like [Library Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis) or [Anna's Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive), which, if they were hypothetically blocked by government, could be accessed via a VPN!

Touchless (K4) second hand kindles are about Â£20. You should get one.
