To me, an "article" is a "blog post" on a website that is not a personal website. I have lots of them bookmarked; see [`/bookmarks`](../bookmarks/). Here, I provide a couple of lists of loosely related articles. Individual ones remain on [`/bookmarks`](../bookmarks/) (things should not be categorised until you have enough per category).

"How frictionless should your life be?"
: - not? (this one got me started on thinking & reading about it) [Highly Predictable Interactions](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/10/highly-predictable-interactions/) - *Terence Eden, 2024-10*
: - [A Frictionless Life Is Also A Life Without Traction](https://thefrailestthing.com/2011/05/05/a-frictionless-life-is-also-a-life-without-traction/) - *L. M. Sacasas, 2011-05-05*
: - [The introverts are winning](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6306/the-introverts-are-winning) - *Marie Le Conte, 2024-07-25*
: personally, I align more with the latter two. While all the modern convenience is good for some people and everyone on some days, I think it's overall bad to rely on.

"why open data?"
: - [The benefits and value of open data](https://data.europa.eu/en/publications/datastories/benefits-and-value-open-data) - *Publications Office of the European Union, 2020-01-22*
: - [What is 'open data' and why should we care?](https://theodi.org/insights/explainers/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/) - *The Open Data Institute, 2017-11-03*
: - [Why Open Data?](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/why-open-data/) - *Open Knowledge, various authors, date unknown*

"how do I start a blog"
: see the many links on [How to start blogging](https://gist.github.com/alifeee/c857bfb45bfd260a9b9dd9c45e4f7478) - *alifeee, 2024-01-17, infrequently updated*

some thoughts on LLMs (Large Language Models) and AI (Artificial Intelligence)
: [TheBullshitMachines.com](https://thebullshitmachines.com/) is a very readable and understandable set of pages about the state of LLMs and generative AI. I'm sure you can guess their overall perspective, and I'm sure you can guess that mine is not far off.
: [Pluralistic](https://pluralistic.net/) has many [posts tagged LLM](https://pluralistic.net/tag/llms/) that are worth reading, notably about [the chances of general intelligence coming from LLMs](https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/), [LLMs being used for botspam](https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/), and [copyright considerations](https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/21/off-the-menu/).
