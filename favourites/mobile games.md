: Polytopia, or [The Battle of Polytopia](https://polytopia.io/) is a mobile (and PC!) game that's like a super-simple version of Civilisation or any of those games that take a really long time. It's free to play alone or you have to buy a tribe (for Â£0.89) to play multiplayer. You can play it on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.midjiwan.polytopia) or Apple or PC or probably a bunch of other places.
