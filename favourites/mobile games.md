Polytopia

: Polytopia, or [The Battle of Polytopia](https://polytopia.io/) is a mobile (and PC!) game that's like a super-simple version of Civilisation or any of those games that take a really long time. It's free to play alone or you have to buy a tribe (for £0.89) to play multiplayer. You can play it on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.midjiwan.polytopia) or Apple or PC or probably a bunch of other places.

80 Days
: [![gameplay image of 80 Days game](./images/mobile-games_80-days.jpg)](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/)
: 80 Days is a narrative adventure through a neo-steam-punk Victorian world, effectively a very fun choose-your-own-adventure built around the story of [Jules' Verne's novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days). It's well worth £4.99 on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inkle.eightydays) or elsewhere. I will consume all 80 Days content, and this is my favourite of it.

Slice & Dice
: [![gameplay image of Slice & Dice](./images/mobile-games_slice-n-dice.png)](https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice)
: [Slice & Dice](https://tann.itch.io/slice-dice) is an incredibly satisfying roguelite where your 5 heroes roll and reroll dice to determine their abilities. Naturally, you end up customising the dice, creating a build (trying not to make infinite reroll for the umpteenth time), and testing your luck. It's got a nice amount of luck vs skill which makes you feel like you're making decisions, and it's very slick.
