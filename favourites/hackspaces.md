I love [hackspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace)!

They're great [third spaces](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/what-is-a-third-space/) where you can get up to a [bunch of stuff](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/hackspace-adventures/) while everyone else also gets up to a [bunch of stuff](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/blog/). While you're doing it, you can even share your ideas and skills!

I'm currently a director of [Sheffield Hackspace](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/) which is in Sheffield and is a Hackspace.

Other hackspaces I've been to are:

- [fizzPOP – Birmingham’s Makerspace](https://fizzpop.org.uk/)
- [Hull Makerspace](https://www.hulllibraries.co.uk/makerspace), which is a library service instead of a community group (which also contains [Hull Zine Library](https://linktr.ee/hullzinelibrary)!!!)
- [Limehouse Labs](https://www.limehouselabs.org/)
- [Cardiff Hackspace](https://cardiffmakerspace.com/)

Other hackspace's I'd like to visit are:

- [DoES Liverpool](https://doesliverpool.com/)
- [Nottingham Hackspace](https://nottinghack.org.uk/)
- [xHain](https://x-hain.de/de/)
- any, really! show me what you got !
