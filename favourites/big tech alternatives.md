I'm a fan of technologies. I'm not a fan of "big tech".

In that vein, here are some resources that point out privacy-respecting alternatives to Google Drive, Microsoft Office, Zoom, Facebook, Google Docs, Adobe, Discord, Meetup, Patreon, Slack, Twitter, Google Chrome etc., etc., etc.

I'm not perfect. I [still use several services](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/notes/my-de-googlification-so-far-switching-from-big-tech/) from "big tech".

- <https://switching.software/>, my favourite website, that provides a beautiful list of alternatives to common websites and apps
- <https://pluja.github.io/awesome-privacy/>, a huge list of privacy-respecting services
- <https://cryptpad.fr/> and <https://framasoft.org/>, two companies who make "shareable Cloud documents" like spreadsheets, documents, polls, and presentations.
- <https://etherpump.vvvvvvaria.org/p/digital-solidarity-networks.raw.html>, a wonderfully formatted, "shared list of tools, practices, and readings for digital solidarity, conviviality and togetherness"
