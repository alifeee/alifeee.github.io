The Contestant
: I watched this at the first Sheffield DocFest I volunteered at, it's about a Japanese man who spends more than a year alone in a room as part of a Truman-esque gameshow. Supposedly, it's the source of the eggplant emoji... metaphor. [on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Contestant_(2023_film))

Fire of Love
: This is a documentary about two madly in-love vulcanologists. It's really, really, cute. Strangely, it's also a [twin film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films#:~:text=Fire%20of%20Love) as Werner Herzog released "The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft" at the same time. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_of_Love_(2022_film))

The Pirate Bay: AFK
: this is a doc about The Pirate Bay. I love it because the "hacker stereotype" comes through amazingly, with the Swedes acting in such a blas√© way in court. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPB_AFK). you can watch it [for free in full on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA_7u2v9KcA)! (or watch [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6qcJt2NPY8) first)
