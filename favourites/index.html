<p>To me, an "article" is a "blog post" on a website that is not a personal website. I have lots of them bookmarked; see <a href="../bookmarks/"><code>/bookmarks</code></a>. Here, I provide a couple of lists of loosely related articles. Individual ones remain on <a href="../bookmarks/"><code>/bookmarks</code></a> (things should not be categorised until you have enough per category).</p>

<p>You can find (in theory) all the books I've (recently) read, as well as the book I am (hopefully) currently reading on my <a href="https://ramblingreaders.org/user/alifeee/">RamblingReaders</a> account. You can follow it on Mastodon !</p>

<dd><img alt="book cover of invisible women" src="./images/books_invisible-women.jpeg" /></dd>
<dd>ever wondered if women are intrinsically at a disadvantage? I hope so. read this book and you'll learn so much more about male-bodied crash test dummies, the benefits-for-all of clearing the snow on footpaths before roads, the tyranny of bus tickets, and way more. it's good. you should read it.</dd>

<dt>The Contestant</dt>
<dd>I watched this at the first Sheffield DocFest I volunteered at, it's about a Japanese man who spends more than a year alone in a room as part of a Truman-esque gameshow. Supposedly, it's the source of the eggplant emoji... metaphor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Contestant_(2023_film)">on wikipedia</a></dd>
<dt>Fire of Love</dt>
<dd>This is a documentary about two madly in-love vulcanologists. It's really, really, cute. Strangely, it's also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films#:~:text=Fire%20of%20Love">twin film</a> as Werner Herzog released "The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice Krafft" at the same time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_of_Love_(2022_film)">wikipedia</a></dd>
<dt>The Pirate Bay: AFK</dt>
<dd>this is a doc about The Pirate Bay. I love it because the "hacker stereotype" comes through amazingly, with the Swedes acting in such a blasé way in court. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPB_AFK">wikipedia</a>. you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA_7u2v9KcA">for free in full on YouTube</a>!

<p>Sometimes, I find a really specific forum post which is so relatable but so niche at the same time. I thought a collection of them could be nice.</p>

<dd>I want all the emails that I get sent to go to my inbox. With Microsoft's, this is simply not possible. The advice is always "add people to your contacts/safe senders list", but the emails I want to see are those from people who's emails I don't yet know, as they are new emails. It's super annoying. Anyway, it's nice to find someone who also thinks so.</dd>

<p>I don't watch many series, because I don't like it when they leave an avaricial cliffhanger after <em>every</em> season (Stranger Things… Snowpiercer… when do they end? never).</p>
<p>What I <em>do</em> like is miniseries, which wrap up their story in 6-to-10 episodes of a single season. Probably just because they're like a massive film.</p>
<dl>
<dt><img alt="cover image for The Terror" src="./images/series_the-terror.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>This is a show about lots of men who freeze to death. It's a retelling of the mystery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">"Franklin's Lost Expedition"</a>, an Arctic Exploration to find the Northwest Passage, on two boats: HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, in 1845-1848. It's 10 episodes, and it really puts you in the environment of the characters and provides a complete, satisfying story. I watched it once via a free trial to an online streaming service, and a second time via downloading it.</dd>

<!-- Around the World in 80 Days -->
<dl>
<dt><img alt="cover image for Around the World in 80 Days" src="./images/series_ATWI8D.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>I will consume any media related to 80 Days Around the World, which probably started because of the <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/">80 Days video game</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Days_(2014_video_game)">on wikipedia</a>). And this one has David Tennant! It's 8 episodes, a bit cheesy at times, and free to watch <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0012w6x/around-the-world-in-80-days">on BBC iPlayer</a>.</dd>
<dt><img alt="cover image for Devs" src="./images/series_devs.jpg" /></dt>
<dd>Devs is a show about some people who get invited to a secret division of a FAANG-like mega-corporation and then shenanigans arise. It's very good. I watched it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087gj19">on BBC iPlayer</a>.</dd>
