Dimensional analysis lets you derive (some) equations (fairly) easily without remembering them.

In particular, my favourite examples are the equations for:

- air resistance
- viscocity of water
- fuel efficiency

…which you can come up with equations with powers in, just by thinking about what quantities and variables would be relevant, and if you're missing some, then your dimensions (hopefully) will be wrong!

(this isn't very in depth - sorry — maybe in future I will write more — maybe not)
