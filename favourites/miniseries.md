I don't watch many series, because I don't like it when they leave an avaricial cliffhanger after *every* season (Stranger Things… Snowpiercer… when do they end? never).

What I *do* like is miniseries, which wrap up their story in 6-to-10 episodes of a single season. Probably just because they're like a massive film.
