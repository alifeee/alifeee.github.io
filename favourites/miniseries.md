I don't watch many series, because I don't like it when they leave an avaricial cliffhanger after *every* season (Stranger Things… Snowpiercer… when do they end? never).

What I *do* like is miniseries, which wrap up their story in 6-to-10 episodes of a single season. Probably just because they're like a massive film.

: This is a show about lots of men who freeze to death. It's a retelling of the mystery of ["Franklin's Lost Expedition"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition), an Arctic Exploration to find the Northwest Passage, on two boats: HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, in 1845-1848. It's 10 episodes, and it really puts you in the environment of the characters and provides a complete, satisfying story. I watched it once via a free trial to an online streaming service, and a second time via downloading it.

<!-- Around the World in 80 Days -->
![cover image for Around the World in 80 Days](./images/series_ATWI8D.jpg)
: I will consume any media related to 80 Days Around the World, which probably started because of the [80 Days video game](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/) ([on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Days_(2014_video_game))). And this one has David Tennant! It's 8 episodes, a bit cheesy at times, and free to watch [on BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0012w6x/around-the-world-in-80-days).

![cover image for Devs](./images/series_devs.jpg)
: Devs is a show about some people who get invited to a secret division of a FAANG-like mega-corporation and then shenanigans arise. It's very good. I watched it [on BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087gj19).
