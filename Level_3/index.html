  <p>Team projects involve a group of up to six students working on a Physics-related problem in either Michaelmas or Epiphany Term. The problems on which the teams will work will be ‘real' in the sense that there is no ‘correct' solution and no script - they might involve building a piece of equipment, testing a product, designing control systems, etc. Experimental work will be based in the Department, and the problem to be tackled will be set either by members of staff from the Department or by local industry. In the latter case, an occasional visit to the organisation concerned will be required. Whilst students will be under the supervision of a member of staff, they will be expected to evolve their own approach to the problem, organise themselves and work effectively as a team. A short written report and an oral presentation will be required from the team as part of their final assessment. Students must attend a talk at the start of the term in which they are undertaking their project.</p>
