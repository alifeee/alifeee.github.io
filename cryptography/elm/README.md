# Elm

This is a rewrite of the Caesar cipher in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

## Requirements

- [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)

## Develop

To preview the page:

```bash
# go to directory with elm.json
cd ./cryptography/elm
elm reactor
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000/src/CaesarCipher.elm](http://localhost:8000/src/CaesarCipher.elm) in your browser.

## Build

Currently, this page is not used in the project, so build instructions are provided for context. For more information, see [Elm's documentation](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).

```bash
# go to directory with elm.json
cd ./cryptography/elm
elm make src/CaesarCipher.elm --output=elm.js
```
