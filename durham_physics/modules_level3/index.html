        <><span style="color: red">COVID-19 information:</span><br />The module
        PHYS3601 Advanced Laboratory will take place entirely on-site (subject
        to government rules), with students working individually on experiments,
        and having greater flexibility over their hours to mitigate against
        further lockdowns. It will be necessary to place a cap on student
        numbers taking this module. Even after expansion into all the available
        rooms (including Level 2 laboratories), the lab leaders have calculated
        that the maximum number of students that can be accommodated whilst
        meeting social distancing requirements is 58. If more than 58 students
        choose this module then the selection of students will occur on the same
        basis as the long-standing cap for PHYS3581 Team Project, i.e., based on
        marks in the Level 2 lab module, PHYS2641.<br />We have had a lot of
        discussion about this and have had to make some difficult decisions in
        order to reduce the likelihood that the cap is exceeded, without being
        unfair on students. In 2020/21:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Advanced Lab module will be unavailable to visiting exchange
            students.
          </li>
          <li>
            MPhys students will not be able to take both Advanced Lab and Team
            Project. This is a change to the information previously published.
            After much discussion it was decided not to apply this change to BSc
            students, who will of course be in their final year; MPhys students
            have the Level 4 project to look forward to.
          </li>
          <li>
            For MPhys Physics and MPhys Physics & Astronomy students, we have
            removed the requirement to take either PHYS3601 Advanced Laboratory
            or PHYS3591 Maths Workshop. These modules have been added to the
            list of optional modules. This is a change to the information

          Team projects involve a group of up to six students working on a
          Physics-related problem in either Michaelmas or Epiphany Term. The
          problems on which the teams will work will be ‘real' in the sense that
          there is no ‘correct' solution and no script - they might involve
          building a piece of equipment, testing a product, designing control
          systems, etc. Experimental work will be based in the Department, and
          the problem to be tackled will be set either by members of staff from
          the Department or by local industry. In the latter case, an occasional
          visit to the organisation concerned will be required. Whilst students
          will be under the supervision of a member of staff, they will be
          expected to evolve their own approach to the problem, organise
          themselves and work effectively as a team. A short written report and
          an oral presentation will be required from the team as part of their
          final assessment. Students must attend a talk at the start of the term
          in which they are undertaking their project.
