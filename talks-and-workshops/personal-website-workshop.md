# personal website workshop

let's make a personal website

this workshop can run in two (about equal) parts:

1. a personal website safari, where we click around a few examples of personal sites, to see (a small slice into) the breadth of sites that people make
2. building your own website, where we use ideas and themes from the safari or your mind to get a simple site on the Internet!

## part 1 - safari

## part 2 - building a personal website

for site hosting we'll use use: <https://neocities.org>... go and create an account!

for inspiration, look at the above sites artistically, and also look at source code for the sites (using inspect element)

either:

- start from scratch (follow the neocities tutorial first)
- use a template, e.g., <https://webmastering.neocities.org/layouts> or <https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/>
- find a drag and drop maker, e.g., <https://hotglue.me/>

### guides

- neocities built in tutorial (you should be shown this when you create an account)
- <https://htmlforpeople.com/>
- <https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/learn/articles/beginners-guide-neocities>
- <https://webmastering.neocities.org/>
