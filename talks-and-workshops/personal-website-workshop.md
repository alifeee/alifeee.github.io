# personal website workshop

let's make a personal website!

this workshop can run in two (about equal) parts:

1. a personal website safari, where we click around a few examples of personal sites, to see (a small slice into) the breadth of sites that people make
2. building your own website, where we use ideas and themes from the safari or your mind to get a simple site on the Internet!

## part 1 - safari

here are 30 semi-random personal websites:

## part 2 - building a personal website

### option 1 - Neocities

for site hosting we'll use use: <https://neocities.org>... go and create an account!

1. think about what you might like to have on your site. for inspiration, look at some of the above sites
2. follow the neocities tutorial
3. "inspect element" on existing websites and copy the HTML of bits you like! (it's all public!)
    1. Firefox/Chrome/Edge: right click > inspect element
    2. Safari: Open Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Developer menu
4. also check out some templates!
    - <https://webmastering.neocities.org/layouts>
    - <https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/>
    - <https://jakechirak.com/howto/makeyourownwebsite/howtohome>

### option 2 - drag and drop maker

I'd encourage you to check out option 1 instead, but if you really want to, there are a few drag and drop makers: https://hotglue.me/ or https://mmm.page/

### why should you care?

a personal website allows you to create and share your creations without conforming to the format of an app or service (think Instagram's square images), lets you display whatever you want (videos? recipes? text? audio?) in whatever format you want, and is shareable without advertising, tracking, or anything you didn't ask for.

The homepage of <https://indieweb.org/> has more opinions about this, and so do many blog posts, including: <https://birming.com/blog-painter/>, <https://localghost.dev/blog/this-page-is-under-construction/>, <https://www.htmlforpeople.com/intro/>, or <https://jamesg.blog/2024/01/06/the-web-is-yours>.

If the sites above didn't give you any ideas of what to put on a website, maybe [100 things you can do on your personal website](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas) by [James](https://jamesg.blog/) will.

### cheatsheets

- CSS, e.g., <https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/>, <https://devhints.io/css>
