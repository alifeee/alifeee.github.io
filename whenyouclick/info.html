        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>
            <a href="./">index.html</a> is the source code of an exhibit at the <a href="https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/">British Science Museum</a>. It is formatted... interestingly. This site is copied from <a href="./code_picture.jpg">an image taken</a> while there.

            The images didn't come with it, so I found my own (by googling "Tim Berners Lee imagesize:250x200" and "computer imagesize:96x175").
