      <h3>What is Diplomacy?</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)">Diplomacy</a>
        is a diceless strategic war game where each player controls several
        territories of a larger geographic area, and must plan ahead and use
        skills of communication and coercion to eventually control the entire
        board, using tanks and boats to capture new territories, as well as
        making alliances and enemies along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diplomacy was originally a board game, and was played either in-person
        or via post. The games the following statistics come from were played
        online, mostly using <a href="https://vdiplomacy.com/">vDipomacy</a>, a
        popular diplomacy website.
        <a href="https://webdiplomacy.net/">webDiplomacy</a> is another popular
        website which has a good explanation of the game on its
        <a href="https://webdiplomacy.net/">homepage</a>.

            >Luck plays no part in Diplomacy. Cunning and cleverness, honesty
            and perfectly-timed betrayal are the tools needed to outwit your
            fellow players. The most skillful negotiator will climb to victory
            over the backs of both enemies and friends. <br />Who do you
